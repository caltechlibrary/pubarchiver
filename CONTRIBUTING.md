# Guidelines for contributing to this project

Any constructive contributions &ndash; bug reports, pull requests (code or documentation), suggestions for improvements, and more &ndash; are welcome.

## Conduct

Everyone is asked to read and respect the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in this project.

## Coordinating work

A quick way to find out what is currently on people's plates and our near-term plans is to look at the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/pubarchiver/issues) for this project, but the possibilities are not limited to what you see there &ndash; if you have ideas for new features and enhancements, please feel free to write them up as a new issue or contact the developers directly!

## Submitting contributions

Please feel free to contact the author directly, or even better, jump right in and use the standard GitHub approach of forking the repo and creating a pull request.  When committing code changes and submitting pull requests, please write a clear log message for your commits.  One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
